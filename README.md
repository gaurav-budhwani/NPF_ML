## MATLAB scripts

### read_AOSnc_file_extract_10282024:
This script processes .nc and .cdf files by extracting data based on file date and category, initializing data fields within a structured .mat file, and saving the consolidated data to a dated .mat file, ensuring continuity across compatible dimensions.

### read_AOSnc_file_append_10282024: 
This MATLAB script processes .nc and .cdf files by locating, categorizing, and appending their data to existing .mat files, updating and saving each .mat file with new data fields.

### all_together_10282024_plot: 
This script processes data from .mat files, performing data alignment, interpolation, flag calculation, and data visualization, including data loading and preparation, data interpolation and transformation, flag calculation and post-processing, data plotting and export, data export to CSV.

### HYSPLIT_COlor_COded_Height_interval_10282024: 
This script visualizes backward atmospheric trajectories from multiple files by plotting latitude and longitude segments colored according to height above ground level (AGL).
